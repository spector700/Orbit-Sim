## About
This is a Python pygame simulation of celestial bodies orbiting in space, created using the Pygame library. 
It allows you to visualize the movement of planets, stars, and other celestial objects in a simple and interactive way.
Accurate mass and velocity are used for the calculations for the orbit.
